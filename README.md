This project presents an intelligent cosmetic recommendation system that leverages Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to suggest suitable skincare products based on a user’s skin type. Using a dataset of 8,649 skincare products containing product details, ingredients, categories, and cleaned customer reviews, the system applies a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to understand contextual relationships within textual data. Unlike traditional rule-based or brand-based recommendation systems, this approach learns from real user experiences and product descriptions to capture hidden patterns related to skin type suitability. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer and demonstrates steady improvements in accuracy and loss over multiple epochs, indicating effective learning. Preliminary results show that the system can successfully associate skincare products with appropriate skin types, highlighting the potential of deep learning and NLP techniques in delivering personalized, accurate, and scalable skincare recommendations within the e-commerce domain.
